 # 🛒 Grocery List Manager

A dynamic Python script that allows users to create and view a shopping list. This project is my first introduction to **Data Structures** (Lists) and persistent loops.

## 📄 Description
Unlike previous scripts that ran once and stopped, this program keeps running using an infinite loop until the user chooses to exit. It acts as a digital notepad, allowing users to add items to a list and view them in real-time.

## 🧠 Concepts Learned
This project focused on **Lists** and **Loop Management**:

* **Python Lists (`[]`):**
    * Learned that a variable can hold multiple items.
    * Used `.append()` to add new data to the end of the list dynamically.
* **Infinite Loops (`while True`):**
    * Created a "Menu System" that stays open, allowing the user to perform multiple actions in one session.
* **The `break` Statement:**
    * Learned how to manually stop an infinite loop when the user selects "Exit".
* **Iterating with `for` Loops:**
    * Used a `for` loop to walk through the list item by item to display the contents.
* **Numbering Items (Enumerate):**
    * Learned how to number the output list (1. Apple, 2. Milk) to make it readable.

## 💻 How to Run
1. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
